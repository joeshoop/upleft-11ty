title-short: Community wildfire mitigation for Pyrezo
title-long: "Pyrezo helps people maintain defensible fire-safe spaces around their homes and businesses, increasing the likelihood they will survive wildfire events. I worked with Pyrezo to design their visual identity, <a href=\"https://pyrezo.com/\">website ↗</a>, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pyrezo-capture/id1636229886\">app ↗</a>, backend annotation tools, and their first physical product—a printable risk report."
